BUGS

Square root function change from math.h C lib to cmath C++ lib caused
change in functionality - now instead of multiplying the number by
itself (squaring it), the new function FINDS the square root of input.

This has been remedied by hardcoding in a num * num function within
the main class, so as to avoid using math.h C lib.

Any contirbution to square a number instead of finding its sqrt as an
imported library function that is close to C++ std libs or as close as
possible is the next logical step.
